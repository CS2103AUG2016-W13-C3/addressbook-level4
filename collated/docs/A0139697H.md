                <p><em>CommanDo</em> is a to-do list manager. It is designed to cater to the needs of people who type fast.  The user manage his/her to-do list by typing commands on a text input - just like in a Command Line Interface (CLI). To-dos are displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI), split into 2 panels of <em>Events</em> (To-dos with a date range) and <em>Tasks</em> (To-dos without a date range), as shown below:</p>

                <h3 id="target-users">Target Users</h3>

                <p>
                    Our main target users (<em>Jim</em>) are characterised by people who...
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have most to-dos coming as emails</li>
                        <li>Update their to-do list very often and wants speed in doing so</li>
                        <li>Want to capture the idea of deadlines in their to-dos</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Our <a href="#appendix-e-product-survey">Product Survey</a> has revealed that many of the existing to-do list managers are unable to satisfy the needs of our main target users, especially in terms of speed of entry and absence of deadlines.</p>

                <h3 id="features">Features</h3>

                <p>In summary, we are focusing on these features:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>2 types of to-dos: <em>Events</em> and <em>Tasks</em>, displayed in separate panels in chronological order</li>
                    <li>Command-line style input, with commands being short, flexible and intuitive</li>
                    <li>Able to search through to-dos easily, empowered by a tagging system</li>
                    <li>Undoing and redoing to-do list operations</li>
                    <li>Importing and exporting to-do list to a human-readable data file</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The full list of features is outlined in our <a href="#appendix-a-user-stories">User Stories</a>. To ensure that the interface is user-friendly and the codebase stays maintainable, we also set ourselves some <a href="#appendix-c-non-functional-requirements">Non-Functional Requirements</a>.</p>

                <p>The <code>MainApp</code> class is the entry point of the application. It is responsible for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>On application launch, initializing all components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with one another.</li>
                    <li>On application exit, shutting down all components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The application consists of 4 components, each with distinct roles:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#ui-component"><strong><em>UI</em> Component</strong></a>: Acts as the middleman between the user and the API provided by <em>Logic</em> (package <code>seedu.commando.ui</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#logic-component"><strong><em>Logic</em> Component</strong></a>: Executes commands from the UI, using the API provided by <em>Model</em> and <em>Storage</em> (package <code>seedu.commando.logic</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#model-component"><strong><em>Model</em> Component</strong></a>: Defines how data is represented and holds the data of the application in-memory (package <code>seedu.commando.model</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#storage-component"><strong><em>Storage</em> Component</strong></a>: Reads data from and writes data to the file system (package <code>seedu.commando.storage</code>)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To minimize coupling and help with unit testing, the API of each component is defined by a single Java interface known publicly. This Java interface corresponds to the name of component (eg, <em>Logic</em> has the interface <code>Logic.java</code>). Each component then exposes its functionality using a concrete class implementing its interface, as listed below:

                    <div class="datagrid">
                        <table>
                            <thead>
                                <tr>
                                    <th>UI</th>
                                    <th>Logic</th>
                                    <th>Model</th>
                                    <th>Storage</th>
                                </tr>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr>
                                    <td><code>UIManager.java</code> which implements <code>UI.java</code></td>
                                    <td><code>LogicManager.java</code> which implements <code>Logic.java</code></td>
                                    <td><code>ModelManager.java</code> which implements <code>Model.java</code></td>
                                    <td><code>StorageManager.java</code> which implements <code>Storage.java</code></td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>

                    <blockquote>
                        Note that for the <em>Model</em> component, besides the API defined by <code>Model.java</code>, it also contains data structures such as the <code>UserPrefs</code> and <code>ReadOnlyToDo</code> classes that the other components are dependent on.
                    </blockquote>

                <p>Underlying all 4 components is the package <code>seedu.commando.commons</code>. It is a collection of utility classes and application constants that are used in all the components. We use <a href="#eventscenter">Event Driven Design</a> for components to communicate with one another, and manage logging through a centralized <a href="logscenter">Logs Center</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="command-execution">What Happens in a Command Execution</h3>

                <p>When the user types a command and presses <kbd class="light">Enter</kbd>, the <em>UI</em> calls the <code>execute(String)</code> method of <em>Logic</em> with the input string. <em>Logic</em> parses the input string amd determines the command type. Then, <em>Logic</em> would call methods of the <em>Model</em> to modify the to-do list, or post events to the <em>Events Center</em> (which would in turn trigger the relevant components to take action). Refer to the following diagram for the execution of command <code>>> add task</code>.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS2103AUG2016-W13-C3/main/master/docs/images/diagrams/command-execution-sd.PNG" width="600">
                    <figcaption>Sequence diagram for executing command <code>>> add task</code></figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Typically, a command would modify the to-do list in the <em>Model</em> (<code>add</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>delete</code>, etc). Within <em>Model</em>, as we have used JavaFX's <em>Observable</em> classes, the modification would trigger a call to the <em>UI</em> to update its view of the to-do list. On top of that, <em>Model</em> would post a <code>ToDoListChangedEvent</code> to the <em>Events Center</em>, which would trigger <em>Logic</em> to call the <code>saveToDoList(ReadOnlyToDoList)</code> method of <em>Storage</em>. Subsequently, when the to-do list is successfully saved to the file system, the event <code>ToDoListSavedEvent</code> would be posted to update the status bar in <em>UI</em>. Refer to the following diagram for a graphical walkthrough of this sequence.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The <em>UI</em> component (package <code>seedu.commando.ui</code>) is in charge of:
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Handing and passing user input to the appropriate methods of the <em>Logic</em> component.</li>
                        <li>Displaying the graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
                        <li>Updating the GUI automatically when data in the <em>Model</em> component changes, done by binding itself to the data using JavaFX's <em>Observable</em> collections.</li>
                        <li>Responding to events posted in <em>EventsCenter</em> that involve a change in the GUI (e.g. opening the help window when <code>ShowHelpRequestEvent</code> is posted).</li>
                    </ul> 
                <p>
                    It uses the JavaFX UI framework (more information about JavaFX <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm">here</a>) - it is made up of GUI parts such as <code>CommandBox</code>, <code>ResultDisplay</code> and <code>EventListPanel</code>. Each part has a class inheriting from the abstract <code>UiPart</code> class (which may be loaded with <code>UiPartLoader</code>), and has a layout defined in a corresponding <code>.fxml</code> file of the same name, located in the <code>resources/view</code> folder. For example, the layout of the <code>MainWindow</code> class is specified in <code>resources/view/MainWindow.fxml</code>.
                </p>

                <h3 id="gui-updates">How the GUI Updates</h3>

                <p>
                    The <em>UI</em> component adds change listeners to 2 <em>Observable</em> lists of <code>UiToDo</code>: one for <em>Events</em> in the <code>EventListPanel</code> class, another for <em>Tasks</em> in the <code>TaskListPanel</code> class. These lists are provided through the API of <em>Logic</em>. When the <em>Model</em> component updates the to-do list, these lists will also update (which will be described in detail later), and this triggers each panel's <code>ListView</code> to update its contents based on the lists. 
                </p>

                <h2 id="logic-component"><em>Logic</em> Component</h2>

                <figure>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS2103AUG2016-W13-C3/main/master/docs/images/diagrams/logic-component.PNG" max-width="500">

                <p>
                    The <em>Logic</em> component (package <code>seedu.commando.logic</code>) is in charge of:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Parsing the string commands from the <em>UI</em> component through the <code>excute(String)</code> method.</li>
                        <li>Calling the appropriate methods of <em>Model</em> and <em>Storage</em> components, or posting the appropriate events on <em>EventsCenter</em> based on the commands.</li>
                        <li>Informing the <em>UI</em> of the results of the commands executed.</li>
                        <li>Responding to any events from <em>EventsCenter</em> that would require an action on the <code>Model</code> or <code>Storage</code> components (e.g. saving the to-do list to the file system with <em>Storage</em> when the <code>ToDoListChangeEvent</code> is posted).</li>
                        <li>Relaying the data of <em>Model</em> to the <em>UI</em> through its methods of <code>getUiEvents()</code>, <code>getUiTasks()</code> and <code>getToDoList()</code>.</li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>

                <h3 id="execute-called">When <code>execute(String)</code> is Called</h3>

                <p>
                    When the <em>UI</em> calls <code>execute(String)</code>, <code>LogicManager</code> passes the string command to <code>CommandFactory</code>. <code>CommandFactory</code>, with the help of <code>CommandParser</code>, would determine the type of command and parse it accordingly, creating one of the sub-class of the abstract <code>Command</code> class. The <code>Command</code> would then have its <code>execute()</code> method called in <code>LogicManager</code>, producing a <code>CommandResult</code>. The <code>CommandResult</code> is finally returned to <em>UI</em>, which contains the user feedback message and indicates whether the command was successful. Refer to the following diagram for a graphical walkthrough.
                </p>

                <h3 id="parsing-of-datetimes">Parsing of Datetimes</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The <code>DateTimeParser</code> class in charge of taking in an input string with <code>parseDateTime(String)</code>, and returning a <code>LocalDateTime</code> if the string represents a valid datetime. Within the class, it first validates and pre-processes the input string (using regex), then delegates the actual parsing to the <a href="http://natty.joestelmach.com/"><em>natty</em></a> library. 
                </p>

                <h2 id="model-component"><em>Model</em> Component</h2>

                <figure>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS2103AUG2016-W13-C3/main/master/docs/images/diagrams/model-component.PNG" max-width="500">
                    <figcaption>Structure of <em>Model</em> component</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The <em>Model</em> component (package <code>seedu.commando.model</code>) is in charge of:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Defining how data in <em>CommanDo</em> is represented in the form of classes (e.g. <code>ToDo</code>, <code>ToDoList</code>).</li>
                        <li>Keeping the user's to-do list in memory and supporting CRUD functionality to it.</li>
                        <li>Keeping track of changes to the to-do list and support undoing and redoing of these changes.</li>
                        <li>Exposing <em>Observable</em> collections of <em>Events</em> and <em>Tasks</em> that are to be shown on the GUI, as well as the filtering, sorting and assigning of indices to these to-dos for the GUI.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 id="changing-undoing-redoing">Changing, Undoing and Redoing the To-Do List</h3>

                <p>
                    Within <code>ModelManager</code>, the <code>ToDoListManager</code> class is in charge of supporting the editing, undoing and redoing of the to-do list, hinging on the <code>ToDoListChange</code> class. All commands define an edit to the to-do list in a consistent way with the <code>ToDoListChange</code> class and the <code>changeToDoList(ToDoListChange)</code> method, which provides greater flexibility in edits, looser coupling between <em>Model</em> and <em>Logic</em>, and more predictable effects from <code>undoToDoList()</code> and <code>redoToDoList()</code>, which undos or redos the most recent <em>ToDoListChange</em> that has been pushed to <em>Model</em>.
                </p>

                <h3 id="preparing-for-ui">Preparing for the <em>UI</em></h3>

                <p>
                    Within <code>ModelManager</code>, the <code>UiModel</code> class is in charge of processing, sorting and filtering the list of to-dos for the <em>UI</em>. It tracks changes to the actual list of <code>ToDo</code> of <em>Model</em>, and when a change happens, it will update the <em>Observable</em> lists of <code>UiToDo</code>, which are exposed via <code>getUiEvents()</code> and <code>getUiTasks()</code> for the GUI. In an update, it will split the new list of <code>ToDo</code> into <em>Events</em> and <em>Tasks</em>, filter out those which shouldn't be displayed on the GUI, sort them, assign indices to each of them in the correct order, and wraps each <code>ToDo</code> in <code>UiToDo</code> with some additional data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A similar update is triggered when the user submits a command that calls <code>clearUiToDoListFilter(...)</code> or <code>clearUiToDoListFilter(...)</code> (e.g. the <code>find</code> or <code>recall</code> command). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <em>Storage</em> component (package <code>seedu.commando.storage</code>) is in charge of the reading of the data for the to-do list and the data for user preferences on the file system, as well as the saving of these data to the file system.

                <p>
                    The <code>StorageManager</code> class consists of <code>XmlToDoListStorage</code>, which is in charge of reading/loading the to-do list data, and <code>JsonUserPrefsStorage</code>, which is in charge of reading/loading the user preferences data. The <code>XmlToDoListStorage</code> class saves/loads the to-do list data to the specified file path in <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> with the help of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/">Java Architecture for XML Binding</a>. On the other hand, the <code>JsonUserPrefsStorage</code> class saves/loads the user preferences data to the specified file path in <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> with the help of the <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome">Jackson JSON Processor</a> library.

                    For components to inform one another that something has happened, we use <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained">Google's Event Bus library</a>, packaged in the <code>EventsCenter</code> class. This is especially important for lower-level components to communicate with higher-level components that they should not be dependent on. An example is the posting of <code>ExitAppRequestEvent</code> by <em>Logic</em> to inform <code>MainApp</code> to close the window.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    All events should extend the <code>BaseEvent</code> class and be placed in package <code>seedu.commando.commons.events</code>.

                <h4>Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git.</h4>

                <p>It is likely that Eclipse failed to recognise the new files that appeared in the new commits. Refresh the project in Eclipse by right-clicking the project in the package explorer panel and choosing <code>Gradle</code> &gt; <code>Refresh Gradle Project</code>.</p>

                <h4>Eclipse reports some required libraries missing.</h4>

                <p>Libraries used by the project might not have been downloaded during project import, or new ones might have been added. <a href="https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W13-C3/main/blob/master/docs/UsingGradle.md">Run tests using Gradle</a> once to refresh the libraries in Eclipse.</p>

                <h3 id="high-ram-usage">High RAM Usage</h3>

                <p>
                    The application currently consumes quite a bit of RAM, up to 150-200+ MB of RAM when we add more than 50 to-dos. We wish to make it less resource-consuming in order to create a better user experience for those with slower systems.
                </p>

                <h3 id="quick-access-keyboard-shortcut">Quick Access Keyboard Shortcut</h3>

                <p>One of the nice-to-have features is to allow the user to quickly summon <em>CommanDo</em> using a customizable keyboard shortcut, even when the application is closed. This would bring convenience to users who would view and edit their to-do list frequently.</p>

                <h3 id="real-time-syntax-highlighting">Real-time Syntax Highlighting</h3>

                <p>A nice-to-have feature is colour-coding the input command in real-time as the user types to reflect the different fields of the command. For example, as the user types <code>>> add event from 10 Oct 2016 9pm to 10pm weekly</code> in the command box, "add" (the command word), "event" (one of the command's fields) and "from" (a keyword in the command) could appear in different colours and the feedback box could state the command format for command word. This allows users to easily validate that their command visually does what they intend it to.</p>

Commands in <em>CommanDo</em> are short, intuitive, flows like natural English! <em>CommanDo</em> recognizes and actively categorizes to-dos into 2 groups: <em>Events</em>, which are to-dos with time windows, and <em>Tasks</em>, which are to-dos accompanied optionally by a deadline. Here's <em>CommanDo</em> at work:

You'll be able to browse through these finished/archived <em>Tasks</em> with the <a href="#recall"><code>recall</code> command</a>.</p>

                <p>*Note that events cannot be marked as done. They will automatically mark themselves as finish when their end datetimes are over.</p>

                <h3 id="find">Finding To-Dos: <code>find</code></h3>

                <p>So you now have a long list of to-dos. Use the <code>find</code> command to search for specific to-dos by their description or their tags. The search targets all upcoming <em>Events</em> (from the current day onwards) and all unfinished <em>Tasks</em>. After doing the search, use the <code>find</code> command again without any keywords to revert to showing all upcoming <em>Events</em> and unfinished <em>Tasks</em>.</p>

                <span><strong>Command Format:</strong></span>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> find [<span>&lt;keyword&gt;</span>...] [#<span>&lt;tag&gt;</span>...]</pre>

                <span><strong>Examples:</strong></span>
                <pre><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> find <span>lunch meeting</span></pre>
                <span>What it does:   Filters to show only <em>Events</em> and <em>Tasks</em> from the current day onwards, with description or tags matching both <code>lunch</code> and <code>meeting</code>.</span>

                <pre><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> find #<span>homework</span></pre>
                <span>What it does:    Filters to show only <em>Events</em> and <em>Tasks</em> from the current day onwards, with a tag <code>#homework</code>.</span>

                <pre><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> find</pre>
                <span>What it does:   Clears previous <code>find</code> command and shows all to-dos from the current day onwards.</span>

                        <li>
                            For a to-do to be matched, all search keywords must be matched in its description and tags, and all search tags must be matched in its tags. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Orderings of the search keywords and tags do not matter â€? keywords <code>Chicken Egg</code> will match <br/><code> Egg Chicken</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Search keywords (but not tags) will match parts of words â€? keyword <code>chicken</code> will match <code>chickens</code>, whereas keyword <code>chickens</code> will not match <code>chicken</code>.
                        </li>

                 <h3 id="list">Listing To-Dos with a Time Constraint: <code>list</code></h3>

                <p>Sometimes you may want to browse your to-dos in certain period of time. Use the <code>list</code> command to search for <em>Events</em> that happen in a specific period of time, and <em>Tasks</em> that are due in that period. The period of time to search can be
                    any time. This means that you can list both finished to-dos and upcoming to-dos as long as they are in the time window you give. If you use this command without any keywords, you will see all to-dos(both finished and upcoming).</p>

                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> list from <span>&lt;start_datetime&gt;</span> to <span>&lt;end_datetime&gt;</span> </pre>

                <h3 id="recall">Browsing To-Dos that are Done: <code>recall</code></h3>

                <p>When you need to review, refer back to, or search through the <em>Events</em> that are over or <em>Tasks</em> that you have finished, use the <code>recall</code> command. It works exactly the same way as the <code>find</code> command - except it only shows to-dos that are considered done. </p>

                <span><strong>Command Format:</strong></span>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> recall [<span>&lt;keyword&gt;</span>...] [#<span>&lt;tag&gt;</span>...]</pre>

                <span><strong>Examples:</strong></span>

                <pre><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> recall</pre>
                <span>What it does:   Show only <em>Events</em> that are already over and <em>Tasks</em> that have been finished. </span>

                <pre><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> recall <span>wedding</span></pre>
                <span>What it does:   Filters to show only <em>Events</em> that are already over and <em>Tasks</em> that have been finished, with description or tags matching <code>wedding</code>.</span>

                <h3 id="unfinish">Marking Tasks as Not Done: <code>unfinish</code></h3>

                <p>Oops, you marked a task as done when it's not exactly done. Simply bring up the list of finished tasks using the <a href="#recall"><code>recall</code> command</a>, then use the <code>unfinish</code> command.</p>

                <span><strong>Command Format:</strong></span>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> unfinish <span>&lt;index&gt;</span>... </pre>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> unfinish <span>&lt;start index&gt;</span> - <span>&lt;end index&gt;</span> </pre>

                <h3 id="store">Setting Save Location: <code>store</code></h3>

                <p>Perhaps you want to save your to-do list in your <em>Dropbox</em> or <em>OneDrive</em> folder that is cloud-synced. The <code>store</code> command lets you do exactly that - it migrates the save file to that of the given file path. Note that the default save location is <code>./data/todos.xml</code>.</p>

                <span><strong>Command Format:</strong></span>
                <pre class="command-format">&gt;&gt; store <span>&lt;file_path&gt;</span></pre>

                <span><strong>Examples:</strong></span>
                <pre><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> store <span>../../Dropbox/work/todolist.xml</span></pre>
                <span>What it does:   Changes the default file path to store the to-do list data to <code>../../Dropbox/work/todolist.xml</code> relative to your <code>commando.jar</code>, and saves the latest data to that file.</span>

                <blockquote>
                    <b>File Paths:</b> A file path can be absolute (<code>C:/Users/Jim/Dropbox/work/todolist.xml</code>) or relative to the <code>commando.jar</code> file (<code>../../Dropbox/work/todolist.xml</code>). You can use any file extension you wish, but ending with <code>.xml</code> is recommended because the date file is in <em>XML</em>.

                <h3>3. Is sharing across devices supported?</h3>

                <p><em>CommanDo</em> doesn't directly support syncing of the to-do list across devices. Instead, use the <code>export</code> command to generate a save data file, transfer the file to another device, and use the <code>import</code> command on the 2nd device to import your to-do list from that save file. Alternatively, use a cloud-syncing service (e.g. <a href="dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>) and the <code>store</code> command to sync the to-do list automatically by setting the save location to the same file on both devices. </p>

                <h3>4. I have some <em>Events</em> or <em>Tasks</em> that are not appearing!</h3>

                <p><em>CommanDo</em> automatically hides <em>Events</em> that are already over and <em>Tasks</em> that are already marked done, to ensure that your to-do list is kept clean. To see these to-dos, use the <a href="#recall"><code>recall</code> command</a>. </p>

                <h3>5. I keep forgetting how to use certain commands.</h3>

                <p>The <code>help</code> command can be used to quickly summon this guide or a relevant section of this guide when you need it. Alternatively, you can just try typing your command - if it is invalid, <em>CommanDo</em> will display the correct command format for that command in the command feedback box just below the command input. This might be helpful for you to correctively learn the command format.</p>

                <h3 id="supported-date-time-formats">6. What date & time formats can I use in my commands?</h3>

                <p><em>CommanDo</em> supports a wide variety of date and time formats, backed by the awesome date parser library <a href="http://natty.joestelmach.com/" target="_blank">Natty</a>. A valid datetime contains a valid date, a valid time, or a valid date and time. A sample of the accepted date & time formats are shown below:</p>

                <p>*If no times are specified in an event, it is assumed to be a whole day event - the event starts at 00:00AM and ends at 23:59PM.</p>

                        <b>Datetime without Date or Time:</b> If your datetime is missing a date or a time, <em>CommanDo</em> will try to infer it. With no date specified, it will be inferred as the current day, or if it is not the first datetime, it will inherit the date of the first datetime. With no time specified, it will be inferred as 1200h.
