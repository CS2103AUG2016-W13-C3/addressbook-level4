                <pre><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> delete <span>2 3</span></pre>
                <span>What it does:  Deletes the to-dos at <em>Index</em> 2 and 3.</span>

                    <b><em>Index</em> of a To-Do:</b> To refer to an existing to-do in <em>CommanDo</em>, its <em>Index</em> is used, which is the number visually tagged to a to-do on the interface. This is clarified in the following figure:

                <h4>Deleting Time Constraints of To-Dos </h4>

                <p>There are situations where the time window of an Event or the due date of a <em>Task</em> become no longer relevant. Similarly, use the <code>delete</code> command, ending with the keyword <code>time</code>. Note that this means that a target <em>Event</em> will become a <em>Task</em> after such a command.</p>

                <span><strong>Command Formats:</strong></span>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> delete <span>&lt;index&gt;</span>... time</pre>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> delete <span>&lt;start index&gt;</span> - <span>&lt;end index&gt;</span> time</pre>

                <h4>Deleting Tags of To-Dos</h4>

                <p>To clear the tags of a to-do, use the <code>delete</code> command as well, but end with the keyword <code>tag</code>.</p>

                <span><strong>Command Formats:</strong></span>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> delete <span>&lt;index&gt;</span>... tag</pre>
                <pre class="command-format"><span class="inputstart">&gt;&gt;</span> delete <span>&lt;start index&gt;</span> - <span>&lt;end index&gt;</span> tag</pre>
