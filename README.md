# CommanDo

<img src="docs/images/Ui.png" width="600"><br>

*CommanDo* is a to-do list manager for the desktop, carefully designed for those who type fast. To-do items are displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI), while you manage your to-do list by typing commands on a text input - just like in a Command Line Interface (CLI). 

*CommanDo* is developed by group CS2103T-W13-C3 as the project for CS2103T.
